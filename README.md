# Vegetarian-Vegan-Restaurants-in-the-USA
*Inspiration
I am an Indian Vegetarian student who has been in the USA for almost about a year. I am currently pursuing my masters in Information Technology and Analytics from Rutgers University, New Jersey. The whole idea of taking this subject is that I find it very difficult to find vegetarian food when I go out to dine with my friends at restaurants here. Even though I can easily find vegetarian restaurants in New Jersey as it houses many Indians and vegetarians but I thought it would be great if I could help other people living in different parts of the USA.
