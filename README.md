# Vegetarian-Vegan-Restaurants-in-the-USA

# Inspiration
An Indian student pursuing my masters in Information Technology and Analytics from Rutgers University, New Jersey. 
The whole idea of taking this subject as part of my analysis is that I find it very difficult to find vegetarian food when I go out to dine with my friends at restaurants. Even though I can easily find vegetarian restaurants in New Jersey as it houses many Indians and vegetarians but I thought it would be great if I could help other people living in different parts of the USA.

# History
USA ranks 3rd in the world for meat-eating population. Over the years, the people have changed their eating habits and now almost 5% of the US adult population have turned vegetarian and 3% of them are vegan as reported by Gallup poll (2018).

# Work
* Visulaized the number of restaurants, the amount spent on these food items, cuisines ordered by customers and their exact address in the USA. 
* Extracted the dataset from Datafiniti's Kaggle.com that has 47 columns and 10,000 observations. You can find the actual data at https://www.kaggle.com/datafiniti/vegetarian-vegan-restaurants
* Performed data cleaning on the dataset using python's pandas and numpy libraries. 
* The final analysis has been done on tableau and an entire story has been created. You can check out the work at https://public.tableau.com/profile/vidhi.rajesh.chitalia#!/vizhome/VeganVeg/VegetarianandVeganRestaurantsinUSA2014-2018
